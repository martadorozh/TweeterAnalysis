# TweeterAnalysis
BTC analysis using Twitter &amp; NLP

Social media such as Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter are places where many people spend some of their free time, writing various messages, uploading photos and videos. The profiles of individual users and the content they publish are the source of a huge amount of information that can be used as data for various analyzes and research. Cryptocurrencies are similar to the most famous currencies in the sense that they are constructed under the influence of public opinion, whether they are factual or not.
In this project, I wanted to analyze the impact of Twitter users' statements on cryptocurrency price predictions through natural language processing using sentiment analysis.
